                Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.<br><b>Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,</b> when an unknown printer took a galley of<br>
                type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. <b><u>It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.<br></b></u>
                It was popularised <b>in the 1960s with the release</b> of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum <u>passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like</u> Aldus PageMaker<br>
                including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
